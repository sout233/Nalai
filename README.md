# Nalai

### English | [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

A modern and fast downloader that supports asynchronous multi-threaded chunked downloading.

The frontend is written in C# and implements Fluent Design using [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui).

The backend is written in Rust and currently performs well (See also: [nalai_core](https://github.com/sout233/nalai_core)).

Tested, **Nalai** works well on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project is currently in a rapid development phase, and some features may not yet be implemented.
